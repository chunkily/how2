1) Consider writing build and watch without gulp. Gulp was not meant to be used like this.
2) Consider serving files directly without writing to a dist folder. 
    On the fly building of files means less storage required, scales better.
    No need to depend on file deleting and syncing between db and dist folder.
    File indexing / watching still has to be handled though.
    Also in this way we can wean ourselves off gulp.
3) Consider integrating a text search engine like elasticsearch. (This would be insane! Insanely cool!)
