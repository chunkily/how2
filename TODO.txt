1) Consider serving files directly without writing to a dist folder. 
    On the fly building of files means less storage required, scales better.
    No need to depend on file deleting and syncing between db and dist folder.
2) Consider integrating a text search engine like elasticsearch. (This would be insane! Insanely cool!)
3) Consider changing up the directory layout of the source files
    Right now katex fonts directory takes up a root folder.
4) Consider setting up a full rebuild when the template changes on watch
