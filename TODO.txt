1) Consider serving files directly without writing to a dist folder. 
    On the fly building of files means less storage required, scales better.
    No need to depend on file deleting and syncing between db and dist folder.
2) Consider integrating a text search engine like elasticsearch. (This would be insane! Insanely cool!)
3) Consider setting up a full rebuild when the template changes on watch
4) Setup a way to normalize tag queries 
    eg. when searching for the plural version, normalize to singular.
