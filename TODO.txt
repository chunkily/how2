1) Consider integrating full text search.
2) Setup a way to normalize queries
    eg. when searching for the plural version, normalize to singular.
    could we use a configuration file?
3) Asyncify / Promisify the build.
4) Make builds incremental instead of full delete create. Possibly use last modified time to determine whether to build. (With an option to do a clean build)
