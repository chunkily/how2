1) Consider integrating full text search.
2) Setup a way to normalize queries
    eg. when searching for the plural version, normalize to singular.
    could we use a configuration file?
3) Asyncify / Promisify the build.
4) Make builds incremental instead of full delete create.
5) Use cookies to store theme settings. Include a theme swap button somewhere.
6) Dockerize the project
