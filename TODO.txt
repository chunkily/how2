1) Figure out watching for file changes and updating database and doc files
2) Make it installable as a global shell command
  
  $> npm install -g

2a) This will require making srcpath and distpath configurables?
2b) possibly use ~/.how2.config
2c) it should also have template and css configs (possible enhancement of multiple css files?)
3) Allow user to navigate and select a howto
4) Launch web server? and open url on selection
5) Turn on syntax highlighting
6) Consider switching to gulp4 alpha
7) Make building a command line option (will require gulp-runner)
