1) Consider serving files directly without writing to a dist folder. 
    On the fly building of files means less storage required, scales better.
    No need to depend on file deleting and syncing between db and dist folder.
2) Consider integrating full text search.
3) Consider setting up a full rebuild when the template changes on watch
4) Setup a way to normalize queries
    eg. when searching for the plural version, normalize to singular.
    could we use a configuration file?
5) Asyncify / Promisify the build.
6) Make builds incremental instead of full delete create. Possibly use last modified time to determine whether to build. (With an option to do a clean build)
7) Experiment with sqlite? I'm worried about lowdb's scalability. Although sqlite might actually reduce performance! Need to test.
