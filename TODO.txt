TODO

1) Asyncify / Promisify the build.
1) Maybe integrate with dropbox directly?
1) Data Persistence? How much performance gains if any will we get if we persist the data to disk.
    Or how about interacting directly with a database?
1) Longer search bar
1) "Scroll To Top" button
1) Settings page?
1) Client-side editor

BUGS

1) Moment is throwing out warnings that input is not a valid format

Weird bug where sometimes the document.date is returned from the document store not as a ISO8601 string but instead as a non-ISO8601 string... Added logging to try to determine why.

This messes up the moment constructor as it expects a string, thereby causing the document to not be updated as the app believes the file has not changed because the modified time is before the document time.

Status: Fixed

This was because server.js was directly editing the JSON object in the store. The objects passed over from how2db.js were object references, not shallow copies. That meant that the line

    templateData.date = moment(templateData.date).local().format('D MMM YYYY, hh:mm a');

was actually propagating those changes back to the 'database'. As a result loading a howto article would alter the date in the elasticlunr index from a well formatted ISO8601 string to the one used for display.

The fix now uses a new object instead of the original reference for the template data.
